nltk's Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning is used to get a numerical score of sentiment in the given text.The compound is taken into account.

5.Feature Scaling to avoid any variable dominance.

6.PCA to transform training data, -> Dimensionality Reduction

Features Used:

Title Model & Headline Model

['Source', 'Topic', 'Facebook', 'GooglePlus', 'LinkedIn', 'publishDay',
       'publishMonth', 'VaderSentimentScore']
